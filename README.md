# Generating templates as CSV files

## Description
The purpose of this code is to generate a CSV file with randomly created attributes. The code utilizes the lovs.py file, which contains a variety of attribute options for some of the attributes. For the remaining attributes, random values will be generated. 

## Files
- `generating.py`: The main file responsible for generating the attributes.
- `functions.py`: This file contains functions necessary for generating random dates, ensuring that the start time is always before the end date.
- `lovs.py`: This file contains lists of values available for some of the attributes.
## Requirements
To run this tool, make sure you have the following packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- random
- datetime

## Usage
2. Run `generating.py` file. Needed attributes will be randomly created and saved as CSV file.
