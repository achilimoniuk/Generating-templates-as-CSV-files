- `functions.py`: This file contains functions necessary for generating random dates, ensuring that the start time is always before the end date.
- `lovs.py`: This file contains lists of values available for some of the attributes.
## Requirements
To run this tool, make sure you have the following packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- random
- datetime

## Usage
1. Prepare the needed files with attributes specifications.
2. Run `generating.py` file. Needed attributes will be randomly created and saved as CSV file.
